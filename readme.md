## About this course
<p>
Mathematics and AI offers an exploration of the intersection between mathematics and
artificial intelligence (AI). Covering state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and 
their mathematical foundations, this course aims to provide students with both a broad theoretical 
understanding and practical skills. The syllabus starts with a brief review of the history of AI,
and current limits and issues. This is followed by an introduction to statistical learning in a supervised setting and 
a deeper dive on neural networks and their applications with some references to current
mathematical research. The syllabus continues with an overview of unsupervised learning methods and 
their applications in feature selection. It concludes with student's presentations of their final projects.
